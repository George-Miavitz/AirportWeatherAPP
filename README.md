# __**Airport Weather Application**__

## **Project Overview**

- This application is designed to work as an internal search application for airports. It will be able to pull weather data from an API by using a search function. 
 The end user will be able to search for an airport and see its current weather conditions along with a prediction of future weather. In the current development, 
 we include four pages: Search, Index (Home page), Current Events/Alerts, and Resources. The home page is what the end user initially interacts with and will include
 links to the other pages after further development. Search includes a search box the end user can type an airport name into and click the “search” button. Current Events/Alerts 
 will contain current and predicted severe weather information. Resources will contain helpful hyperlinks and the ability to contact support for the application if needed.

## **Future Enhancements**

- An API will be used to connect airports to the search function. We are still trying to determine if the search function should be listed on the home page or separate for clarity 
 of its function. This is due to the other pages we would like to incorporate into the web application. Weather data will be referenced from METAR and TAF data which seems to be open-sourced.

## **Collective Findings**

- After researching other repositories and web applications that perform similar functions, we have found many resources implemented into other applications. 
 These are listed as such. METAR and TAF are often used when observing current and future airport weather. This is due to the instruments used around airports 
 to do the exact function we are trying to incorporate into the internal web application.
